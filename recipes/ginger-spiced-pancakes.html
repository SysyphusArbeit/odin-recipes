        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>In hopes of creating pancakes that remind me of the Christmas season, I came up with these ginger pancakes. These are a delicious way to celebrate Christmas breakfast with your family.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 ⅓ cups milk</li>
                <li>1 egg</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon applesauce</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons ground ginger</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>2 cups baking mix</li>
                <li>cooking spray</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Beat milk, egg, applesauce, ground ginger, vanilla extract, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Whisk baking mix into the milk mixture until just combined into a loose batter.</li>
                <li>Prepare a skillet with cooking spray and place over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Ladle about 1/4 cup batter into the prepared skillet; cook until bubbles begin to form on the top, 3 to 5 minutes. Turn the pancake and continue cooking until the other side of the pancake is golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes more. Transfer pancake to a plate and cover with a lid to keep warm. Repeat until batter is completely used.</li>
            </ol>
